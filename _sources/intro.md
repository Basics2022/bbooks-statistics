Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on designing systems that can learn from data to improve their performance on a task. ML frameworks include supervised learning (e.g., regression and classification), unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering, compression, principal component analysis), and reinforcement learning (e.g., planning and control). ML emphasizes practical problem-solving, grounded in statistical methods, numerical optimization, and enabled by advances in computing hardware.
